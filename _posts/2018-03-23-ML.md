I think I may have developed a strong liking for ML languages now. I am really interested in ocaml and F#, and may give some time to
ML inspired languages such as Rust. ML seems really fun to program in, and they have decent tooling and backing as well. It's a pretty
big decision, but I think ML languages are meant for me. 

I was very confused between FSharp and Ocaml and then decided, I'll learn both. It was so simple, yet, I was confused for quitea while,
thinking deeply about it. It just always reminds me of, how much I hate to make choices ><.
