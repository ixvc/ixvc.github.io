I have been slightly confused about using either C or C++ in my projects. Both seem to be fine languages, however with so many things C++ has, I don't find any uniform
standards on how to design programs in C++. C is simple, and does things right, however C++ has features when you need them. It's really confusing me, on what I should 
do.

I really wana learn C because I aim to pick up open-source projects that I want to contribute to. But should I then spend time on a mordern language, that is actually worth
working with, rather than C?
